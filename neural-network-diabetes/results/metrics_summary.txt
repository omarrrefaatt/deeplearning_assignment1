Neural Network Binary Classification – Metrics Summary

Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Test Samples: 154

Confusion Matrix: True Negative (TN): 82 False Positive (FP): 18 False
Negative (FN): 21 True Positive (TP): 33

Overall Test Accuracy: 75%

Class 0 (No Diabetes): Precision: 0.80 Recall: 0.82 F1-score: 0.81
Support: 100

Class 1 (Diabetes): Precision: 0.65 Recall: 0.61 F1-score: 0.63 Support:
54

Macro Average: Precision: 0.72 Recall: 0.72 F1-score: 0.72

Weighted Average: Precision: 0.74 Recall: 0.75 F1-score: 0.75

Analysis Summary: The model achieved 75% accuracy on the test dataset.
It performs better on the non-diabetic class than the diabetic class.
Recall for Class 1 (0.61) indicates missed positive cases (false
negatives). Training and validation curves show stable convergence with
minimal overfitting.
